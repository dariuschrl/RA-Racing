                    <h1><span>The Journey So Far</span></h1>
                    <p>I come from Romania, a country where racing is not as appreciated as it should be, but I am determined to change that, and become a professional race car driver, with the help of <b><i>RA Racing</i></b>, a club that I am a part of.<br><br>
                        Ever since I was a kid, I dreamed of driving fast cars, and as of last year, I took the plunge. I signed up for a race car driving course, and I was hooked. The experience was mind-blowing, and I realized that I had found my calling.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>At the beginning of 2023, I took part in the BRSCC Fiesta Junior Scholarship in the UK, which allowed me to understand the world of motorsport and how things work in other countries. Despite not winning it, I learned a lot and became a better driver.</p>
                    <p>My first race was in March 2023 when I drove around Motorpark Romania. Throughout the season, there were moments of uncertainty, times when I couldn’t see the full picture. But I came across a quote from <i>The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse</i> by Charlie Mackesy, which resonated with me:</p>

                    <p><i>"I can't see a way through," said the boy. <br>
                            "Can you see your next step?" <br>
                            "Yes." <br>
                            "Just take that," said the horse.</i></p>

                    <p>It made me realize that I didn’t need to have it all figured out. I just needed to focus on the <i>next step</i>. <br>In my last race of the season and also the most important one, I put aside all my long time future goals and focused on the present moment. After 8 hours of hard racing through tough conditions, I managed to cross the finish line and secure <b>first place</b> in my class.	
                        
                        <br><br>That next step is entering the <b><i>Clio Cup</i></b>, an international series that is popular among amateur drivers all across the world. For this, I will need to <i>buy a new car and train even harder</i>, but I will do everything that I can do to succeed in pursuing my dreams.<br>
                        Now, I’m looking ahead, with the <b><i>World Endurance Championship</i></b> as my ultimate goal. It won’t be easy, but with each race, I’ll be a step closer. As the horse wisely said, I just have to <i>keep moving forward</i>, one step at a time.</p>
